# Fisherman's Whar

Repo for a local multiplayer twin-stick shooter called Fisherman's Whar. The game will be local multiplayer couch PVP, with fast rounds-based game play. The project is inspired by the gameplay of Boomerang Fu, a staple of me and my friends' game nights. The fast paced and fun feel of Boomerang Fu allows it to be replayable and competitve with friends, and I hope to emulate what it does well.
